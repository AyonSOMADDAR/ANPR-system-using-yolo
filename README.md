# ANPR System

ANPR stands for Automated Number Plate Recognition System.
This project handle with the problem of using your online trained and deployed on Roboflow.
You just need to put your trained model api key the code will do the rest 
of work for you can use this code for deployment of your model.
I have also provide link of my trained model which was getting

98.4%
mAP

98.2%
precision

96.7%
recall

My model:: https://universe.roboflow.com/yolo-xxmil/licence-plate-ellea

The dataset used in this is very huge which helped me getting this accuracy
and the data set is a collabration of many different dataset found on
different websites and sources. I don't think you find datset this huge any where else.

This code over you normal trained model use an easyocr model to 
also get the text readed from the number plate.
